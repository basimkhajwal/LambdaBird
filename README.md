# LambdaBird
A purely functional flappy bird clone written using the Elm programming language as a challenge to learn a new language as well as implement a game in it at the same time.

## TODO
- Add a score label to show the current score
- Create an image for the lambda bird
- Create a logo for the menu
- Add a death screen
